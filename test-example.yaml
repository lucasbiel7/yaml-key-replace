# Test file to demonstrate smart paste feature
#
# Smart Paste Examples:
# 1. Copy "test.endpoint.put" and paste anywhere - it will add only "put:"
#    at the same level as "get" (not inside "get", not recreating the full structure)
# 2. Copy "test.database.connection" and paste - it will create the full structure
#    since "database" doesn't exist yet
# 3. Copy "test.endpoint.get" and paste - it will navigate to the existing property
# 4. Copy "test.endpoint.get.timeout" and paste - it will add "timeout:" inside "get"
#
# Smart Copy Example:
# Place cursor on "get" below and press Ctrl+Shift+C (or Cmd+Shift+C on Mac)
# It will copy "test.endpoint.get" to your clipboard

test:
  endpoint:
    get:
      url: /api/test
      method: GET
    # Try pasting "test.endpoint.put" - it should add "put:" at the same level as "get"
    # Try pasting "test.endpoint.delete" - it should add "delete:" at the same level as "get"
    # Try pasting "test.endpoint.get.timeout" - it should add "timeout:" inside "get"
