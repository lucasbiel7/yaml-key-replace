# Test file to demonstrate smart paste feature
#
# Smart Paste Examples:
# 1. If you copy "test.endpoint.put" and paste below, it will add only "put:"
#    at the correct indentation level (not recreate "test.endpoint.put")
# 2. If you copy "test.database.connection" and paste, it will create the full structure
#    since "database" doesn't exist yet
# 3. If you copy "test.endpoint.get" and paste, it will navigate to the existing property
#
# Smart Copy Example:
# Place cursor on "get" below and press Ctrl+Shift+C (or Cmd+Shift+C on Mac)
# It will copy "test.endpoint.get" to your clipboard
test:
  endpoint:
    get:
      url: /api/test
      method: GET
    # Try pasting "test.endpoint.put" here - it should add only "put:" at this level
    # Try pasting "test.endpoint.delete" here - it should add only "delete:" at this level
